# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

To complete this project we used urls to retrieve GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website. using JavaScript and the D3.js library we pulled the coordinates and magnitudes from the data. Using the Leaflet library, we plotted the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created the interactive map. We additionally added information for where the tectonic plates lie, and highlighted the major earthquakes (over 5.) with separate map options.
